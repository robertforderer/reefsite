        NFL Scheduling: Optimization of flying distance
    </p>
    <p>
        Executive Summary
    </p>
    <p>
        Our team has developed a model for deciding the NFL (National Football
        League) game schedule for one season. We used linear programming in
        order to formulate a solution that will reduce the cumulative miles
        traveled by all NFL teams. To formulate the problem, we used data for
        the distance between each team and every possible opponent in the NFL.
        We then implemented the constraints and assumptions that affect the
        current NFL schedule. We were then able to develop a linear program
        using Open Solver to arrive at an optimal schedule. The optimization of
        the NFL schedule will result in lower traveling costs. In addition to
        traveling costs, our solution has implications such as reducing fuels
        costs and environmental impact of energy use to travel.
    </p>
    <p>
        Introduction
    </p>
    <p>
        Every year the NFL is confronted with a specific scheduling problem.
        Which teams are going to play each other and when? In addition, travel
        plans must be made in order to get teams from their hometown to the
        opponent's stadium. One factor that the NFL does not seem to consider
        in their formulation of this problem is the effects that all of the
        travel and fuel consumption will have on the environment. In addition,
        the distance traveled can also affect team’s overall strength and
        performance due to the time spent in the air. In the 2016 season, NFL
        teams will travel a cumulative distance totaling more than 500,000
        miles (cbssports.com). Jet fuel costs approximately 5 dollars per
        gallon (aviationweek) and a Boeing 747 is estimated to use 5 gallons
        per mile (Howstuffworks.com). Therefore, the NFL's immense traveling
        schedule incurs large economic and environmental costs. Our group will
        use a method called linear programming to create a more cost effective
        and environmentally friendly schedule.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Problem Description
    </p>
    <p>
        Linear programming is a system of formulation that contains one
        objective determined by various decisions. These decisions are also
        subject to constraints. The objective of our model is to create an NFL
        schedule that minimizes the total distance traveled by all 32 teams
        over the course of a single 17-week season. We must decide on every
        possible matchup in every possible week. The constraints in our model
        are the scheduling customs of the NFL.
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to create a fair and competitive schedule, certain rules must
        be applied to our plan. First, each team can only play one game per
        week in the 17 week NFL schedule. Football is a physically demanding
        sport. Therefore, if teams competed more than once a week, more players
        would acquire injuries. Another measure used to reduce player injuries
        is that every team gets one week off, called a “bye”. This means every
        team plays a total of 16 games with one bye. Four teams will receive
        byes in weeks 5 through 12.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another set of rules that dictate the NFL schedule are related to the
        NFL conference and division system. Figure 1 below displays the
        breakdown of the NFL’s 32 teams and how they are divided into two 16
        team conferences: the NFC and the AFC. These two conferences are then
        divided into four divisions containing four teams each. Every team
        plays every other team in its own division twice, totalling six
        inter-division games for each team. In addition, each team also plays
        teams out of its division but in its conference six times. Finally,
        each team plays four teams in the opposite conference. The sum of these
        three categories is sixteen. A complete, seventeen week NFL schedule is
        created once one bye per team is added.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/hPNLgVM.png" style="width:70%">
    </p>
    <p>
        There are also constraints for home and away games. Every team plays every team within its division once at home and once away each season. They also play three inter-conference games at home and three inter-conference games away. Lastly, the teams play two intra-conference games at home and two intra-conference games away. The total for each team is eight home games, eight away games, and one bye. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The last important rule in the NFL scheduling problem is the fact that
        non-division teams cannot play each other more than once. The number of
        teams, and the number of games allows teams to        play each other. Every season, each team
        plays only 13 out of 32 teams. This fact leads to many possible
        variations of the NFL schedule. Therefore, our objective is to use
        linear programming to locate the variation that minimizes the total
        distance traveled.
    </p>
    <p>
        A key assumption of our problem is that we are only considering air
        travel miles between each city, and excluding other travel distances
        such as buses to the stadiums and hotel. Another assumption is that
        each team will fly back home after each away game. In reality, teams
        typically fly home to regroup even if they have an away game the next
        week. In addition, we will not be considering the schedule of other
        games or events occurring in each stadium that might cause a scheduling
        conflict. Our last assumption is that we are only accounting for
        domestic games. We will not be considering games played in London
        because there are only three games played in London out of a total of
        256 regular season games.
    </p>
    <p>
        Results
    </p>
    <p>
        Our problem contained more than 17,000 variables by considering every
        possible game in every possible week. Nevertheless, robust Open Solver
        software was able to solve the problem in approximately 90 seconds.
        The schedule resembled a normal NFL schedule, with every team playing
        sixteen games with a bye. Furthermore, the scheduling traditions of the
        NFL described above were also met. The software produced a schedule
        totaling slightly more than 380,000 miles. This schedule reduces the
        number of miles traveled by teams this season by approximately 28
        percent. Even if three games were played in London and one game in
        Mexico City, our model would still have a shorter distance than the
        current schedule.
    </p>
    <p>
        Conclusion
    </p>
    <p>
        While the NFL's focus is not scheduling with travel distance in mind,
        it was the sole focus of our group's report. Teams in our model travel
        slightly more than 380,000 miles while NFL teams this year will travel
        more than 500,000 miles. The positive benefits of a schedule with less
        traveling include increased player performance, money savings, and
        lessened environmental impact. Nevertheless, the schedule we produced
        could not be used by the NFL right now. The current NFL schedule is
        based on the fact that all thirty-two teams could not possibly play one
        another in a sixteen game schedule. Therefore, the actual NFL
        schedulers have a multiple-year perspective in their approach. They
        make sure that every team plays one another every few years. If our
        current one-year schedule was used every year, certain teams would
        never play one another. Nevertheless, creating a multiple year schedule
        that considers the constraint that every team must play at least once
        every few years is possible. If our team had more time, we would have
        created such a schedule. We also would have added two-week road trips
        so an away team could play two away games with roughly the same travel
        distance as one game. Although our current one-year schedule could not
        realistically be implemented, adding those two improvements might make
        a schedule that could actually compete with the NFL's current schedule.
