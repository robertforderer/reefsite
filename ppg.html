    Using Multiple Regression to Analyze Points per Game of 50 NBA players
</p>
<p>
    I decided to use predictor variables from the 2014-2015 season to predict
    2015-2016 points per game of 50 of the top NBA scorers. (The season starts
    in the fall and ends in the spring, so one season is referred to with two
    years.) I was attempting to predict the scoring of individual players as
    opposed to what their rank was. For example, instead of predicting the ppg
    of the #1 scorer, I tried to predict the scoring of Russell Westbrook.
    Certain top players had to be left out of the model because they were
    injured for a significant part of either season.
</p>
<p>
    The first step in creating my regression model was choosing variables that
    correlate with points per game. I gathered my data from
    Basketball-Reference.com which contains extensive basketball statistics for
    every NBA player in every year. The first variable that I used was points
    per game of the previous season. While players may rise and fall in their
    careers, a player's points per game is typically somewhat similar to their
    previous season's points per game. I thought this statistic would show a
    positive correlation. The second variable I thought my correlate with
    points per game is a player's rank in points per game. The highest scoring
    player (rank 1) will probably have a points per game somewhere from 27
    points per game to 30 points per game. The fiftieth highest scoring player
    (rank 50) will probably have a points per game of approximately 15. I
    thought this statistic would show a negative correlation. The third
    variable is a player's salary. (I used 2015-2016 salary for this variable
    because a lot of the young, up and coming, players signed big contracts and
    had considerably smaller salaries in the 2014-2015 season.) Points per game
    is probably the most important statistic in basketball and I thought that
    higher paid players would probably score more. I thought this statistic
    would show a positive correlation. The fourth variable is assists per game.
    (An assist is when a player passes the ball to a second player who scores.)
    I thought that players who pass the ball more than shoot the ball would
    score less. Therefore, I thought this variable might have a negative
    correlation with points per game.
</p>
<p>
    The fifth variable I chose was minutes per game. I thought that if a player
    was on the court for more minutes, they would probably score more. I
    thought this statistic would show a positive correlation. The sixth
    variable I chose was the highest points per game of a different player on
    the team. If the player I was testing had the highest points per game on
    the team, I chose the second highest points per game of a player on the
    team. In an NBA game, there are only so many shots that can be taken by one
    particular team. Therefore, one star-player can reduce the points scored by
    other players by taking away their shots. For example, if Michael Jordan is
    on a team, his teammates will score less because Jordan is taking all the
    shots. I thought that this variable would have a negative correlation with
    a player's ppg because high scoring players take away points from his
    teammates. I chose a seventh numeric variable because I thought all seven
    were important. My seventh numeric variable I call "career regression
    slope". This variable is intended to capture young players on the rise and
    older players on the decline. I took a single variable regression of every
    one of my players with time as the X (ending with 2014-2015 season) and ppg
    as the Y. For players who played more than six years, I used the last six
    years of their career. I then took the slope of this regression and used it
    as an X variable. (see appendix for an example) I thought that older
    players whose numbers are decreasing would be predicted to have less ppg
    while younger players whose numbers are increasing would be predicted to
    have more ppg. Young players on the rise were intended to have a higher
    career regression slope while older players were intended to have a lower
    or even negative career regression slope. Therefore, I thought this
    variable would show positive correlation.
</p>
<p>
    My eighth variable was a binary variable. It was whether or not a player
    was an All-Star in 2014-2015 or not. Typically, All-Stars score more than
    non-All-Stars. Therefore, I thought this variable would show positive
    correlation.
</p>
<p>
    I then performed a process known as step-wise regression to figure out the
    best mixture of variables to predict ppg for 2015-2016 NBA players. In
    forward step-wise regression, I locate the best single predictor and then
    gradually add other variables. I was surprised that some of my variables
    did not make it to the final equation. Minutes per game did not help the
    model when combined with 2014-2015 ppg. The points per game ranking was
    very similar to the 2014-2015 ppg. When I combined these two variables, the
    model barely improved. Salary had almost no correlation with points per
    game at all. After closely examining my data, I could see why higher
    salaries are typically given to players who have already proven themselves
    after about five or six years in the NBA. Furthermore, contracts are
    renegotiated every three or four years. Even if a player has his first good
    season, he will probably not be paid for his success for a couple years.
    Therefore, many older players averaged lower ppg and earned higher salaries
    while many younger players averaged higher ppg and earned a lower salary.
    In the end, salary was not a good predictor. I was also surprised that my
    "career regression slope" predictor did not make the final equation. The
    statistic did add to the model's predictability. Nevertheless, it did not
    add enough to become a part of the final model. The last variable removed
    from the final equation was the binary All-Star variable. It hardly
    improved the final model.
</p>
<p>
    My final model included three numeric variables: 2014-2015 ppg, assists per
    game, and highest ppg of a different player on the team. I was not
    surprised that 2014-2015 ppg made the final model. An individual player's
    ppg might vary quite a bit throughout his career. Nevertheless, a player's
    ppg does not change very much one season later. This predictor was by far
    the best variable. Nevertheless, assists per game and highest ppg of a
    different player both added considerably to the model. I thought that the
    more assists a player recorded, the less points he would record because he
    passed more and shot less. (An assist is when a player passes the ball to a
    teammate who scores.) This hypothesis was incorrect. In fact, the more
    assists that a player records, the more points he records. I believe this
    correlation stems from the fact that players who record more assists and
    more points simply have the ball more often than players with lower assists
    and lower points. Some NBA players, especially stars, are at the center of
    every game and have the ball much more frequently than other players. I
    think this statistic captures the "super-star" aspect of the game. In fact,
    one more assist will probably give a player about .4 more points.
</p>
<p>
    The third variable in the model is highest ppg of a different player on the
    team. As I expected, a high scoring player will lead to lower scoring
    teammates. While this variable alone did not predict 2015-2016 ppg very
    well. When this variable was added to 2014-2015 ppg, the two variables
    combined very well. The analogy I used above was that if a super-star like
    Michael Jordan is on a team, his team mates will score less because Jordan
    is taking every shot. A modern day example of this trend is Russell Westbrook's up tick in production after the departure of his super star teammate, Kevin Durant. In fact, one more point for the highest scorer on the
    team will negatively detract from his teammate's scoring by about .3
    points. I think this variable was especially effective because it captured
    the element of team play and not just individual play.
</p>
<p>
    Therefore, some of my variables were ineffective, like salary, while others
    were so similar to 2014-2015 ppg that they were not necessary. In the end,
    2014-2015 ppg counted for the majority of the prediction. Assists per game
    captured the unique aspect of the game in which players who have the ball
    more will score more. And lastly, highest ppg of a different player on the
    team added a team element to the prediction model. This model's average
    accuracy (RMSE) is about 2.4 ppg.

    Before I display the step-wise, here is an example of the statistic "Career regression slope". I used last six years of career and took the slope as an X variable. This variable is meant to capture rising stars and older players on the decline.
    Lebron James' negative coefficient demonstrates that he is an older player with declining scoring figures.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/akuttuX.png"><br><br>
Sum of squares shows almost no difference, F test not necessary.<br><br>
Remove All-Star binary variable.<br><br>
Final Equation:<br><br>

step 5: testing for error<br><br>
1) Normal distribution of errors:<br><br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/VuVyfvY.png"><br><br>
The line is fairly straight.<br><br>
This chart shows how many data points fall in different standard deviation zones.<br><br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/oT0WoQd.png">
<p>
    The center has the majority of the errors. One side has 23 total data points and the other has 27 total points. The errors are not a perfect normal distribution but they are close to a normally distributed data set. 
</p>
2) Heteroskedasticity:<br><br>
top half of errors standard deviation: 2.73<br>
bottom half of errors standard deviation: 2.10<br>
The quotient of the top half divided by the bottom half is 1.3. Because this statistic is in between .5 and 2, I can conclude that this data set does not contain heteroskedasticity.<br>
<p>
    3) Durbin Watson: This data set should be tested for Durbin Watson because the data points are ordered from highest ppg to lowest ppg. 
</p>
Ho: p = 0 if DW is greater than du we will conclude Ho<br>
Ha: p > 0 if DW is less than dl, we will conclude Ha<br>
DW = [(et-et-1)^2]/[et^2]<br>
DW = 471.62/285.58 = 1.65<br>
using 5% significance level, dl = 1.42 and du = 1.67<br><br>
<p>
   Therefore, the result of the DW test is inconclusive because DW falls in between these two figures. Nevertheless, the DW is very close to du and can almost be considered completely free of autocorrelation.
