        Background:
    </p>
    <p>
    Company ABC is going to enter City XYZ selling a daily used, non-perishable
    product. Our team Analyzed this market entrance using two separate linear
    programming models to minimize Company ABC's costs.
</p>
    <p align="center">
        Forecasting Demand:
    </p>
<p>
    Before we could create these models, we had to calculate the demand of each
    district of City XYZ. Company ABC recently completed a survey in each
    district regarding daily usage of similar products and percent of answers
    statistics for three categories: "Definitely Yes", "Yes", and "Maybe".
    Thomas Juster, a famous statistician, argued that customer survey questions
    typically contained underlying probability implications. Eric and Larry
    Risen, of BioTrak Research Inc., a market research firm, discussed a study
    in which Juster's scale was tested on individuals purchasing soup and
    yogurt. The surveyors then asked the customers which goods they actually
    purchased. Eric and Larry Risen used this data to interpret Juster's scale
    more accurately. Juster interpreted responses to "Certain, Practically
    Certain", "Very Probable", and "Fairly good possibility" as 99%, 80%, and
    50% probability of purchase respectively. Eric and Larry Risen found that
    more accurate interpretations of these responses would be 83%, 66%, and 39%
    respectively. (Risen, 4) Company ABC's survey uses slightly different
    wording than Juster's surveys and they are selling neither yogurt nor soup.
    Nevertheless, Eric and Larry Risen's study involves customer follow up.
    Furthermore, the regression line that they used to create the response
    definitions had an R<sup>2</sup> of .9435. (An R<sup>2</sup> score that is
    close to 1 is an indication that their model is extremely accurate.)
    Therefore, I decided to interpret "Definitely Yes" as 83%, "Yes" as 69%,
    and "Maybe" as 39% purchase probability. (See appendix for exact demand
    calculations.) It is important to note that obtaining data based on
    customer feedback is not as accurate as time series forecasting methods.
    Once a few months of data has been generated, the supply chain manager
    should use data from actual store sales as opposed to the data generated
    from the customer survey to estimate average demand and standard deviation
    of demand.
</p>
<p align="center">
        Store Location Decisions:
    </p>
<p>
    Once our team calculated demand, our next step was to determine which
    stores to open and which districts to assign these stores to. We used a
    method called linear programming to make these decisions. Linear
    programming is a process in which decisions are made on variables given
    certain constraints. The goal of linear programming is to either minimize
    or maximize an equation called "the objective function". In our team's
    linear program, the goal was to minimize the cost of opening stores. The
    constraints in our linear program involved a sales minimum of 100 and a
    sales maximum of 226. (We wanted to leave a 24 unit cushion for possible
    fluctuations in demand.) Another important constraint was the maximum
    distance that a store could be from a district it served. If the maximum
    distance was low, then the cost of opening stores would be relatively small
    while shipping would be high. However, if the maximum distance was small,
    the cost of opening stores would be high while the cost of shipping would
    be low. Because we do not know where Company ABC's customers live, we do
    not know the cost of delivery. Nevertheless, since stores typically deliver
    to customers on a daily basis, we decided that constraining the maximum
    distance to a small number while incurring higher store costs was the best
    decision. Therefore, I constrained the maximum service distance for each
    district to ten miles except for district 9. (District 9's retail store is
    14 miles away.) A maximum service distance of twenty miles incurred
    approximately $12,000 less in store costs. Nevertheless, "last mile
    delivery" is often one of the most expensive parts of a supply chain; the
    money saved from more efficient daily delivery routes would certainly
    outweigh the added store expense. The result of the 930 variable linear
    program was 17 retail stores assigned to 30 districts and a total cost of
    $69,400. (See Appendix)
</p>
<p align="center">
        Factory, Production, Inventory,and Delivery Decisions :
    </p>
<p>
    Once our group made decisions regarding retail stores and district
    assignments, we constructed a second linear program to make production,
    inventory, shipping, and production facility decisions. Since retail store
    to district relationships had been considered in the first model, this
    model only accounts for retail stores and production facilities. This
    linear program represents one week of operation in City XYZ for Company
    ABC. Inventory from day 7 is linked to day 1. Therefore, the program is a
    weekly plan that Company ABC could use over and over. (To start the weekly
    cycle, Company ABC would have to start with start with day 1 inventory
    levels as specified by the program.) If demand shifts dramatically, new
    demand numbers could be entered into the program and a new weekly plan
    could be developed within ten minutes. This new program would have the same
    production facilities because these facilities would have already been
    constructed. Nevertheless, production plans, shipping assignments, and
    inventory levels can always be adjusted in case demand fluctuates
    significantly.
</p>
<p>
    The majority of the decision variables in the second linear program are
    either numeric variables for amounts shipped or binary variables
    representing trucks traveling from one point to another. These two sets of
    variables are linked so that when a certain amount of product is shipped
    from one point to another, a corresponding binary truck variable is
    activated. The "amount shipped" variables allow the program to make
    production, shipment, inventory decisions, while the "binary truck"
    variables allow the program to account for shipment costs between
    locations. Another feature of our model is that one truck is capable of
    making stops at multiple retail locations before returning to a factory. In
    fact, if a retail location records that a truck arrives and does not travel
    to another retail location, the truck is prompted to return to a factory.
    This feature has its own set of binary decision variables, signifying a
    return trip from any retail store to any existing factory. The last set of
    decision variables are facility decision variables which signify whether or
    not a production facility is constructed. These variables allow the program
    to consider shipment and inventory decisions at the same time as facility
    location decisions. The result of the 6,595 variable program is building
    facilities at locations 1, 2, and 3. A total of 29 trucks leave the
    factories and 93 total deliveries are made. Each retail store keeps between
    8 to 11 units of safety stock at all times. The cost of one week's
    operation in the second linear program is approximately $220,000.
    Therefore, the total cost of one week of operation is approximately
    $289,000, not including daily van deliveries from retail stores to
    customer's homes. (See appendix for formulation and results.)

    <u>(3 important model 2 clarifications)</u>
</p>
<p>
    <u>
        1)Trucks do not always return to their starting factory, but they
        always return to a factory that exists.
    </u>
</p>
<p>
    <u>
        2) In some instances, A truck delivers 0 to a retail store. This only
        arises because the shortest distance between two points is not always a
        line in this data set. For example, from District 28 to District 2 (6
        miles), District 2 to District 6 (5), District 6 to Factory 3(19) =
        District 28 to 3.(30) Thus, making multiple stops with 0 units is still
        optimal.
    </u>
</p>
<p>
    <u>
        3) In two instances, "amounts shipped" figures not originating in the
        factories appear. However, the unaccounted units of product are not
        then sold. Furthermore, the model can still be interpreted as if they
        did not exist and they do not increase the objective function.
