    Executive Summary<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Anadolu Efes Brewery and Malt Industry is the largest company in producing
    and distributing malt, beer, and plastic crates in Turkey. It holds about
    78% of the Turkish beer market share. The current goals of Anadolu Efes is
    to improve their distribution network to reduce transportation costs, and
    also a capacity expansion plan. With such a large share in the beer market,
    it is anticipated that demand will increase over the years. This following
    report and analysis uses a method called linear programming to determine
    the most cost effective amount of breweries to open, and when to expand to
    ensure so that they can fulfill the anticipated increase in demand. Our
    team found that Izmir was the best location to build a brewery because of
    savings in long term shipping costs.
</p>
<p>
    Introduction<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Anadolu Efes is a Turkish beer company that processes malt, brews beer, and
    finally distributes this beer to consumers. Anadolu Efes Brewery and Malt
    Industry Corporation currently owns two breweries and is looking to expand.
    Their current breweries are already fully expanded and close to their
    capacity limits. The company already sent technical staff to scout possible
    new locations for the breweries. Based on the water quality, beer demand
    concentration, and the distance between malt plants and breweries, the
    technical staff chose the following: Izmir, Sakarya, and Adana. Team Alfa
    will be using a mathematical process called linear programming to determine
    the most cost effective amount of breweries to open, when to open and
    expand them, and the cheapest transportation and production plan for
    Anadolu Efes. The process of linear programming utilizes multiple data
    inputs and subjects them to limitations or constraints in order to make
    particular business decisions. These decisions are made with the goal of
    either minimizing or maximizing an equation called “the objective
    function”. In the case of Anadolu Efes, the objective function minimizes
    the construction, expansion and transportations costs.
</p>
<p>
    Model and Methodology<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Anadolu Efes is planning to add up to 3 more breweries to its two step
    transportation process with three separate location categories. The first
    category is malt plant sites. Anadolu Efes has three malt plant sites:
    Afyon, Konya, and Izmir. The malt plants in Afyon and Konya receive
    domestic malt while the malt plant in Izmir receives imported malt. The
    second location category is breweries. Anadolu Efes currently operates two
    breweries, one in Istanbul and one in Ankara. They are currently
    considering three possible new brewery locations: Izmir, Sakarya, and
    Adana. The third location category is distribution centers. Anadolu Efes
    has six distribution centers: Istanbul, Izmir, Antalya, Bursa, Kayseri, as
    well as an export center in Izmir. Team Alfa built a model resembling this
    distribution system with the goal of finding the lowest cost. To find the
    lowest cost, Team Alfa has to consider shipping cost and construction cost.
    One of the biggest costs would be constructing a brewery and expanding a
    brewery. When considering brewery construction and expansion decisions, we
    must consider building and transportation costs together. We built the
    model to consider the next 20 years of operation. Our model is constrained
    by the following factors: a brewery must be built before it is expanded,
    building and expanding can only be done once per brewery, neither the malt
    plants’ nor brewery’s capacities can be exceeded, the demand of each
    distribution centers must be met, and malt transported to each brewery must
    be processed into beer and sent to distribution centers. (See appendix for
    Model formulation)
</p>
<p>
    Model Assumptions<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Anadolu Efes is a large company that has many operating costs including
    production, marketing, and corporate costs. Our model does not take all of
    these costs into account. Another key limitation is the fact that our model
    only accounts for one ingredient, malt, in the production of beer. Beer
    also requires sugar, hops, and water. Our transportation model does not
    account for the transportation costs of these ingredients. Furthermore, we
    assume that there is no spilling during the transportation process. If
    there is any spilling, more malt, more beer, and more transportation
    expenditures will be required to fulfill the demand of the various
    distribution centers.
</p>
<p>
    One of the key assumptions of our model is that the demand forecast is
    accurate. Our model accounts for the next twenty years of operation.
    Forecasting demand far into the future is extremely difficult; therefore,
    our team assumes that the demand in year three stays the same in years four
    through twenty. In the first year the breweries in Istanbul and Ankara have
    18 million liters of excess brewing capacity to meet any fluctuations in
    demand. In the second year after building a brewery the model expresses an
    excess 49 million liters of brewing capacity. Finally, in the third through
    twentieth year, the model expresses an excess of 40 million liters of
    brewing capacity. The forecasts for the first, second and third years are
    probably fairly accurate and Team Alfa is comfortable with the excess
    capacity cushions stated above. However, assuming that demand will stay the
    same in years three through twenty is a dangerous assumption. The
    probability that demand will increase by more than 40 million liters in the
    next twenty years is very high. Therefore, more effort should be allocated
    to forecasting for the next twenty years. Furthermore, Anadolu Efes should
    be aware that the distribution model suggested by Team Alfa will need to
    change if total beer demand reaches a level of 540 million liters.
    Nevertheless, any fluctuation in beer demand would only be reflected in
    phase two, the brewing process. Even if there is a large fluctuation in
    demand, Konya has enough excess malt processing capacity to supply more
    than 400 million liters of beer. On the other hand, if demand suddenly
    decreases, additional options for downsizing the distribution center might
    be considered. Despite the fact that our model considers twenty years,
    decision makers must be aware that operational decisions must be made every
    few years in order to adapt to the current business environment.
</p>
<p>
    Analysis and Findings <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Team Alfa found that building a brewery in Izmir in year 2 and expanding
    that brewery in year 3 is the cheapest solution to satisfying Anadolu Efes’
    growing demand. A brewery must be built by year 2 and expanded by year 3 to
    satisfy the company’s growing demand. Nevertheless, the construction of the
    brewery should be delayed to year 2 because the total cost of the
    distribution and production plan would increase by approximately 3 million
    dollars if the brewery was built in year 1. In order for a brewery
    construction in Izmir to take place in year 1, the price of the brewery
    would have to drop from 75 million dollars to 32 million dollars.
    Furthermore, the interest rate is an important factor when considering when
    to build a new brewery. Team Alfa found that constructing a new brewery
    would be optimal if interest rates dropped from 10% to 4%.
</p>
<p>
    With the new addition of the Izmir brewery, relationships between the malt
    plants, breweries, and demand nodes change slightly throughout the plan. In
    year 1, no malt is imported through the port of Izmir. Once a brewery is
    built in year 2, approximately 8 thousand tons of malt is imported. Once
    the brewery is expanded in year 3, approximately 13 thousand tons of malt
    is imported. Imported malt is a cheaper option than domestic malt because
    shipping malt between the port, brewery, and distribution center in Izmir
    is extremely cost effective.
</p>
<p>
    Other than importing malt, malt plant output and the relationships between
    malt plants and breweries will remain similar throughout the model. The
    Afyon malt plant will deliver most of its output to Istanbul and a small
    amount of its output to Ankara. Konya will continue to deliver its entire
    output to Ankara. (See appendix for exact shipping and output figures)
</p>
<p>
    Some of the relationships between breweries and distribution centers will
    change as well. The Istanbul demand node will continue to receive all of
    its beer from the Istanbul brewery. The distribution center in Izmir used
    to satisfy some demand from the Istanbul brewery and some of its demand
    from the Ankara brewery. Once the brewery is opened in Izmir, most of the
    Izmir demand will be satisfied with Izmir brewery while some will be
    satisfied with the Ankara brewery. Once the brewery is expanded, all of
    Izmir’s demand will be satisfied by output from the Izmir brewery. Team
    Alfa decided in part 1 of our analysis that Antalya should receive its beer
    from Ankara instead of Istanbul. Antalya’s will continue to receive beer
    from the brewery in Ankara throughout our model. However after Izmir’s
    expansion, a small amount of beer will be shipped from Izmir to Antalya.
    Team Alfa in part 1 of our analysis decided that Bursa should receive beer
    from Istanbul instead of Ankara. Throughout our model, Bursa continues to
    receive all of its beer from Istanbul. The entirety of Kayseri’s demand is
    be satisfied by Ankara in the original plan and every year of Team Alfa’s
    model. And lastly, beer will be exported from Izmir as soon as a brewery is
    opened in Izmir. (See exact shipping and production figures in the
    appendix)
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Conclusion: High-level discussion of findings and recommendations. This
        section should be geared towards a nontechnical executive.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The analysis above addresses the most cost effective capacity expansion
    plan for Anadolu Efes to satisfy the anticipated increase in demand, and
    also maintain its high share in the beer market. Team Alfa’s
    recommendations to Anadolu Efes is to build a new brewery in Izmir in year
    two, then expanding this brewery in year 3. Building in year 2 as opposed
    to year 1 saves Anadolu Efes three million dollars. Although Izmir is the
    most costly to build and expand, the long term savings associated with its
    location make Izmir the best place to build a brewery. The main
    relationships that change between our model and the existing model are
    changing the brewery-distribution pairs from Ankara/Bursa and
    Istanbul/Antalya to Ankara/Antalya and Istanbul/Bursa. Throughout the
    capacity expansion in the next three years, most of the relationships
    between Malt plants, Breweries, and Distribution Centers remain the same.
    However, Izmir’s brewery addition leads to Izmir distribution center
    receiving beer from Izmir. This new brewery also leads to the importing of
    malt as part of the distribution plan. Our distribution plan required
    looking forward twenty years in order to make the brewery construction
    decision; however, future changes in the external environment may lead to
    changes in the distribution plan.
